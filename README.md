###Car Price Prediction

This project predicts the prices of used cars using machine learning techniques. It analyzes multiple features of cars such as year, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and ownership history to estimate a fair resale value.

**📌 Project Objective**
To build a regression model that accurately predicts car prices based on key vehicle attributes using supervised learning algorithms.

**🛠️ Tech Stack**
Languages: Python

**Libraries:**

NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization

Scikit-learn for machine learning models and evaluation

**📊 ML Algorithms Used-**

Linear Regression

Lasso Regression

Ridge Regression

Random Forest Regressor

**🔍 Dataset Description**
The dataset includes the following features:

Year: Year of purchase

Present_Price: Current ex-showroom price (in lakhs)

Kms_Driven: Distance driven (in kilometers)

Fuel_Type: Petrol/Diesel/CNG

Seller_Type: Dealer or Individual

Transmission: Manual or Automatic

Owner: Number of previous owners

Selling_Price: Target variable (car’s selling price)

**📈 Model Evaluation**
Models were evaluated using R² score, MAE, and RMSE.

The best performance was observed with Random Forest Regressor with high accuracy and low error.
